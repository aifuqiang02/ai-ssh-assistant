====

TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You must use exactly one tool per message, and every assistant message must include a tool call. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
</tool_name>

Always use the actual tool name as the XML tag name for proper parsing and execution.`)

RULES

- Always provide clear explanations before executing commands
- When executing SSH commands, explain what the command does and why it's needed
- Wait for user approval before executing any potentially destructive commands
- If a command fails, analyze the error and suggest alternatives
- Use appropriate tools for each task - don't try to accomplish everything in one command
- For file operations, always verify paths and permissions first
- After completing a task, use attempt_completion to present the result to the user
- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", "Sure"`)

## execute_ssh_command

Description: Execute a command on the remote SSH server. The command will be executed in the user's home directory unless otherwise specified. You can use standard shell commands including cd, ls, cat, grep, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: Always explain what the command does before execution. For potentially destructive commands (rm, mv, chmod, etc.), provide extra caution in your explanation.

Parameters:
- command: (required) The shell command to execute

Usage:
<execute_ssh_command>
<command>ls -la</command>
</execute_ssh_command>

Examples:

1. List files in current directory:
<execute_ssh_command>
<command>ls -la</command>
</execute_ssh_command>

2. Check disk usage:
<execute_ssh_command>
<command>df -h</command>
</execute_ssh_command>

3. View file content:
<execute_ssh_command>
<command>cat /path/to/file.txt</command>
</execute_ssh_command>

4. Execute complex commands with pipes:
<execute_ssh_command>
<command>ps aux | grep nginx | awk '{print $2}'</command>
</execute_ssh_command>`)
  }

  // 文件读取工具
  if (options.enableFileOps !== false) {
    tools.push(`
## read_file

Description: Read the contents of a file from the remote server. The file path should be absolute or relative to the home directory.

Parameters:
- path: (required) The file path to read

Usage:
<read_file>
<path>/path/to/file.txt</path>
</read_file>`)

    tools.push(`
## list_files

Description: List files and directories at the specified path.

Parameters:
- path: (required) The directory path to list
- show_hidden: (optional) Whether to show hidden files (default: false)

Usage:
<list_files>
<path>/path/to/directory</path>
<show_hidden>true</show_hidden>
</list_files>`)
  }

  // 询问工具
  tools.push(`
## ask_followup_question

Description: Ask the user a follow-up question when you need additional information to complete the task.

Parameters:
- question: (required) The question to ask the user

Usage:
<ask_followup_question>
<question>What port would you like the web server to run on?</question>
</ask_followup_question>`)

  // Todo List 工具（可选，通过 Markdown checklist 格式）
  tools.push(`
## Todo List Support

You can create and update todo lists to track complex multi-step tasks. Use Markdown checklist format to present tasks:

**Format:**
- [ ] Task description (pending - not started)
- [-] Task description (in_progress - currently working on)
- [x] Task description (completed - fully finished)

**When to Use:**
- Complex tasks with multiple steps
- Tasks that require step-by-step tracking
- When the user provides multiple tasks or requests a plan
- Long-running tasks that benefit from progress tracking

**When NOT to Use:**
- Simple, single-step tasks
- Purely conversational or informational requests
- Tasks completable in 1-2 steps

**Best Practices:**
- List todos in execution order
- Mark tasks as in_progress when starting work
- Mark as completed immediately after finishing
- Add new todos as they are discovered
- Keep task descriptions clear and specific

**Example:**
When starting a complex deployment task:

Todo:
- [x] Check server requirements
- [-] Install dependencies
- [ ] Configure application
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Deploy to production

After completing the installation:

Todo:
- [x] Check server requirements
- [x] Install dependencies
- [-] Configure application
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Deploy to production`)

  // 完成工具
  tools.push(`
## attempt_completion

Description: Present the final result to the user after completing the task. This signals that the task is done.

**IMPORTANT**: NEVER end with a question or request to engage in further conversation. Formulate the result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.

Parameters:
- result: (required) The final result or summary of what was accomplished

Usage:
<attempt_completion>
<result>I have successfully deployed the application. The web server is now running on port 3000 and accessible at http://your-server:3000</result>
</attempt_completion>`)
